# ms-band-azure aka Band on the Run

# Welcome

This project was created by David Gristwood and Peter Daukintis, with a couple of goals in mind:

- Explore the Microsoft Band and how to program against it
- Create a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app for Windows 10 that connects to the Microsoft Band and displays key information, such as heart rate, etc
- Use Microsoft Azure to collect the telemetry from the app and log, processes and chart the data
